## About dataset: SentiCap
### "Exploring Emotional Analysis through Multimodal Sentiment Data: A Senticap Data
The dataset contains both text and image data. The text has been separated from its corresponding image and the image is on its own. The text is the description of whatâ€™s in the images. There are 2000+ training sentences containing sentiments and 2000+ images with some of these images repeating for some sentences. The dataset contains a separate column for a single word sentiment value, which makes up the whole sentence. A separate column for tokens of the sentence and a final column for the value of positive or negative sentiment.

### Project:
The goal of this project is to design a system to describe an image with emotions, and present a model that automatically generates captions with positive or negative sentiments. We will make a model for Sentence level Multimodal Sentiment Analysis. By using Pytorch, that can take both the textual and visual information in the dataset, we will perform sentiment analysis and come to a conclusion that whether a positive or negative sentiment is found.
